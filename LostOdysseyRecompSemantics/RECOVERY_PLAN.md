# Semantic recovery plan

The user goal is complete semantic recovery of the game into human-readable, buildable C/C++ with behavior comparison against the original PPC before individual runtime replacements. The current work is the first staged slice of that whole-program goal and does not narrow it.

## Evidence gates

Each function advances independently through these gates:

1. **Identity** — match the XEX and generated-source evidence, and record provenance.
2. **Type and ABI** — establish guest addresses, endianness, calling convention, preserved registers and object boundaries.
3. **Control flow** — reproduce branches, loops, failure paths and return values.
4. **Side effects** — account for memory writes, ordering, cleanup and discarded results.
5. **Dependencies** — recover the contracts and effects of external callees.
6. **Behavior** — compare return values, guest-memory bytes, call traces and relevant snapshots through a bounded adapter.
7. **Runtime** — validate the adapter and behavior in representative scenes before considering a replacement.
8. **Complete** — mark the function complete only when the preceding evidence is sufficient for its scope.

The statuses in recovery.json are deliberately independent. A readable implementation does not imply differential, runtime, scene or complete status.

## Current order

The route is whole-program and staged: establish address/source identity at the boundary, deduplicate catalog candidates without erasing address identities, audit entry and body boundaries, then recover types and ABI, prioritize leaf functions and their dependencies, assemble validated subsystems, build adapters for behavior comparison, validate representative scenes, and replace runtime boundaries one at a time. This checkpoint retains fifty individually tracked readable entries, including pointer-vector cleanup, alongside shared leaf, accessor and integer family maps covering 1,591 unique addresses with one overlap. Manager-startup adds six supplemental cases, manager-allocation and fallback-resize add 12 each; their image provenance and runtime boundaries remain limited. Some cases still use bounded stubs or synthetic combinations. Exact-body families are evidence for implementation reuse only: keep every entry address mapped and independently compared. Current work continues family and dependency recovery alongside runtime adapters; deeper vtable methods, CRT/native-kernel and unwind boundaries, ABI adapters and representative runtime scenes remain open. The free-return ABI, manager lifetime/concurrency and complete object contracts remain unresolved. The cache trace comparison does not establish hardware synchronization behavior. Generated PPC remains the baseline.

## Acceptance

A function is eligible for default runtime replacement when its identity, types, control flow, side effects and dependencies are documented; its bounded behavior comparison has a reproducible receipt; its runtime adapter is checked; and its scene evidence covers the intended scope. The source and bounded comparisons can be reviewed before runtime acceptance. A passing static-library build alone does not satisfy these gates. Runtime replacement, full-game recovery, frame-rate claims and cross-platform acceptance require separate evidence.

The current progress report covers fifty individually tracked entries plus the family maps, totaling 1,591 unique addresses (942 leaf, 304 accessor and 296 integer addresses with one overlap), with runtime acceptance, scene and complete status still zero. Accessor and integer family runners cover 1,824 and 2,960 comparisons; pointer-vector cleanup covers ten boundary comparisons. The standalone Windows Release semantics library passed once with the new modules. The earlier 49-function hash receipts remain historical after shared-header changes; runtime, scene, complete semantics, MMIO, fault and concurrency remain unverified, and no hook is enabled by default. Do not use WSL or Docker for this Windows-local workflow.
